// Write a function prev_str that takes a &str as input and returns a String.

// This function converts the &str by replacing each character with its predecessor. For example:

// 'b' becomes 'a'
// 'f' becomes 'e'
// 'B' becomes 'A'
// 'A' remains 'A'
// 'a' remains 'a'
// If the character is not a letter, it remains unchanged.
